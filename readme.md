# Persephone Web Frontend

This is the web frontend for the [Persephone](https://persephone-asr.org) project.

This provides an easy to use interface to the Persephone ASR tool that you can run from your web browser.
The aim of this project is to make it easy for people to use the Persephone in their transcription workflows without needing to do software development.

This frontend interacts with the [Persephone web API](https://github.com/persephone-tools/persephone-web-API).
